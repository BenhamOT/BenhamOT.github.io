Welcome to my website! My name is Oli Benham and this site is my attempt to document some of the 
interesting data projects I've worked on, my observations of data industry trends and some occasional tech ramblings.

I'm current working as a Data Engineering Consultant at Infinity Works, part of Accenture. In my last 
couple of projects I've been mostly doing data platform engineering roles focused on AWS Data Engineering 
and Architecture. Before Infinity Works, I worked as a Data Scientist at a small 
Manchester based tech consultancy called Intechnica.
