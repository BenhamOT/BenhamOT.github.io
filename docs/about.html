<h2>About</h2>

<p>
Welcome to my website! My name is Oli Benham and this site is my attempt to document some of the
interesting data projects I've worked on, my observations of data industry trends and some occasional tech ramblings.

I'm current working as a Data Engineering Consultant at Infinity Works, part of Accenture. In my last
couple of projects I've been mostly doing data platform engineering roles focused on AWS Data Engineering
and Architecture. In my spare time I'm also working on a couple of ML projects; my
    <a title="github" href="https://github.com/BenhamOT">Github</a> contains some of these example projects. Before Infinity Works, I worked as a Data Scientist at a small
Manchester based tech consultancy called Intechnica.
