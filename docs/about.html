<h2>About</h2>

<p>
Welcome to my website! This site is my attempt to document some of the
interesting data projects I've worked on, my observations of data industry trends and some occasional tech ramblings.

I'm current working as a Data Engineering Consultant at Infinity Works, part of Accenture. Recently, I've been
doing a lot of data platform engineering, but my background is a mixture of data engineering, ML engineering and
architecture. Right now I'm trying to learn Rust. My <a title="github" href="https://github.com/BenhamOT">Github</a>
contains some example side projects I occasionally get to work on.
